# COVID 19 Data Exploration Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on the analysis and exploration of COVID-19 data. The primary goal is to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on a global scale by examining various metrics such as cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.

### Features

- SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
- Data analysis and visualization techniques
- Performance tuning for complex queries
- Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for advanced data manipulation

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates, sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The data is organized into tables, with relevant attributes for comprehensive analysis.

## Tools Used

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Microsoft SQL Server

## Files

- `Covid Data Exploration.sql` - The main SQL script file containing all the queries used for data exploration and analysis.
- 'CovidVaccinations' and 'CovidDeaths' - the two excel files on which the visualization was performed.

## Usage

The main script can be run using any standard SQL server that supports T-SQL. Ensure you have the necessary database and tables created before executing the script.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`
2. Open the `.sql` file using SQL Server Management Studio or any SQL IDE of your choice.
3. Run the script in an environment connected to a SQL database.

## Insights

Some key insights gained from this project include:

- **Trends Over Time**: Analysis of the data showed that certain regions experienced waves of COVID-19 cases correlating with the absence of strict public health measures or the emergence of new virus variants.

- **Vaccination Impact**: Data suggests a strong inverse correlation between vaccination rates and mortality rates, highlighting the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing the severity of disease outcomes.

- **Demographic Factors**: Certain demographics, particularly age and underlying health conditions, were identified as significant factors in COVID-19 case severity and mortality rates.

- **Resource Allocation**: Regions with higher population density but lower hospital bed availability faced more significant challenges in managing the surge in cases, pointing to the need for better resource allocation.

- **Public Health Policies**: Implementation of public health policies such as mask mandates and social distancing had a measurable effect on the reduction of case numbers in various regions.

- **Global Disparities**: The data analysis brought to light the disparities in COVID-19 impact and response efficacy, with lower-income countries facing more prolonged and severe outcomes due to limited access to healthcare and vaccinations.
